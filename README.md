# About this Project 
In this Project, I have to replicate the search jobs section which consists of various task -- 

1) Fetching API data --- (done)
2) Infinite scrolling --- (done)
3) Filter jobs based on Min. Experience, Job Type, Min. Pay, Roles/Tech Stack, Company, Location --- (done)
4) Multiple filter feature - (done)
5) Use vanilla CSS - (done)
6) Handled responsiveness - (done)

# Best Performance Practices
1) Applied custom debouncing while filtering based on Company and Location
2) Use throttling while implementing infinite scroll
3) Added comments for easy understanding of code
4) Follow approach of pushing code after every small milestone
5) Avoid using extra dependencies like lodash for debouncing, tailwind etc.
